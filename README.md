# Quilt Manager React

An app paired with Etsy for managing craft work.  Utilizes APIs from Etsy to import data and prevent duplicate entry.
The site allows a guest to select from available patterns after contact through etsy.

## Description

Phase I is to all quilt customers to visit this site as a guest and to see and select favorite
  quilting patterns from the database.  The site owner can see all guest favorites and match them to 
  etsy orders to get the exact pattern to load into the quilting computer.

## Getting Started

The react app can be deployed to the root of the intended web site.
the .env file will contain the relative path to the conpanion node app including listening port.


### Dependencies

This requires read-only access to a folder named artifacts

### Installing

Should be a vanilla build and deploy of a React app on the site.
Modify the .env file for the relative locations and connections to node.
The setting for APPMODE is temporary and will allow testing of a Guest account vs the site owner.
  This setting will be removed in favor of a traditional login screen.

### Executing program

For now it runs local under NPM - NPM RUN DEV
